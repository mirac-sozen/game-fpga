FPGA VGA Car Game
A playable game developed using VHDL on an FPGA board, featuring real-time VGA output. The project includes timing control, synchronization, and pixel rendering modules.

This project was developed as a university course project with my colleague Hüseyin Ömer Demirci.
The main objective of the game is to steer the car (controlled by car_controller.vhdl) to avoid obstacles generated by obs_gen.vhdl.
The player can only move the car horizontally (left/right).
The collisiondetector.vhdl module continuously checks for a collision between the car and an obstacle.
Upon collision, the game stops. 
The ssegdriver.vhdl module displays the current score on the board's 7-segment displays.

HARDWARE
This project was designed and tested using the following setup:
-FPGA Development Board: Digilent Nexys 3
-FPGA Chip: Xilinx Spartan-6
-Development Software: Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.7.
-Monitor: Any standard monitor with a VGA input (tested at 640x480 @ 60Hz).

CONTROLS
The game is controlled using the onboard buttons of the Nexys 3 board. These assignments are defined in the new.ucf constraint file.
-BTN_LEFT: Move Car Left
-BTN_RIGHT: Move Car Right
-BTN_CENTER: Start Game / Reset

TECHNICAL DETAILS AND MODULE DESCRIPTION
The project is designed with a fully modular approach.
-top_module.vhdl: The main module that instantiates and connects all sub-modules to the board's physical I/O (VGA port, buttons, 7-segment displays).
-freqdivider.vhdl: Used to generate the 25MHZ clock frequency for VGA from the board's main 100MHz oscillator.
-timinggen.vhdl: Generates the HSYNC (Horizontal Sync) and VSYNC (Vertical Sync) signals required for the 640x480 VGA standard, along with the active pixel counters.
-pixel_renderer.vhdl: Based on the current pixel coordinates (h_count, v_count) from timinggen, this module decides what color to draw (car, obstacle, or background) and outputs the corresponding RGB signals.
-car_controller.vhdl: Updates the car's current horizontal position based on button inputs.
-obs_gen.vhdl: Generates the obstacles and manages their vertical movement down the screen.
-collisiondetector.vhdl: Detects a collision by comparing the coordinates of the car and the obstacles.
-ssegdriver.vhdl / sseg.vhdl: Converts the score from BCD to 7-segment display format.
-debouncing.vhdl: Filters the physical noise (bouncing) from button presses to ensure a single, clean logic signal is detected for each press.
